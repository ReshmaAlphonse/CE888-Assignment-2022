Effects of Imbalanced data-A brief study


I have Chosen 3 datasets from UCI, Kaggle, etc. made them imbalanced. For each of them, I created three versions/surrogates (in addition to the original one) by
subsampling one of the classes:
(1) Low imbalance (65%)
(2) Medium imbalance (75%)
(3) High imbalance (90%)

Three dataset’s were selected based on classification type and relatively balanced. One of the datasets is to classify mushrooms based on it’s characteristics. The characteristics are given as
features of 23 columns. Second dataset is of drug classification with 6 features. Third dataset is of health classification with 22 features.
